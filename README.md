This shiny application is created to estimate the MPG of cars with the inputs of car weight, 1/4 mile time, and transmission type. Users only need to input these features on the left side panel, and click the **GO!** button. The predictive model will estimate the MPG value, and display it on the right side panel.

The predictive model used by this application was built using the mtcars dataset with linear regression method for the Regression Models course. The detailed report of this regression study can be found at my [RPubs report](http://rpubs.com/liyisong1028/regression_model), and my [github repository](https://github.com/liyisong1028/RegressionProject).
